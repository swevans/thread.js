 FUTURE IDEAS:
 - Wrapper for objects constructed on the thread, so you can call functions directly on them
 - Wrapper for function calls on the thread so you can tell when they're complete and get the return result
 - Change import scripts to use XHR so CORS (and thus IE10 everywhere) is supported
